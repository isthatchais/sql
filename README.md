# Overview

This is my first attempt at working with an SQL database using python.  I was able to create the database and use pytohn and bottle to create a wevb app that will interact with the SQL database.  It is a very simple program with a practical application.  I didn't spend a lot of time with styling on this I just wanted it to be funcitonal. 

Here is a video of me going through the software

# Relational Database

The database for this project is very simple. I have only one table that has 5 columns.  The table is called todo and the columns are category, task. id, due date, and person in charge.
